Windows. This will allow you to use the Add or Remove

======================================================
EXAMPLE DATA SETS

Several example data sets have been included with 
this package. They are placed in a sub-folder named
EPA SWMM Projects\Examples in your My Documents folder.
Each example consists of a .INP file that holds the
model data and a .TXT file with suggestions on running
it.

* EXAMPLE1.INP models runoff quantity and quality
  from a small watershed and its routing through
  a network of storm sewers. It can be run in
  either single event mode or in continuous mode
  using the companion rainfall file.

* EXAMPLE2.INP is Example 1 of the 1988 EXTRAN Users
  Manual. It illustrates how SWMM5 can graphically
  compare its results to observed data stored in a
  text file.

* EXAMPLE3.INP illustrates the use of the rule-
  based controls feature in SWMM5 for simulating
  real-time control.

* EXAMPLE4.INP shows how the new LID controls feature
  added to release 5.0.019 was used to reduce runoff
  produced from a 29 acre mixed development site.
